# Retail Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting US monthly retail sales using various time series models. The analysis highlights the resilience of long-term economic trends, especially after disturbances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Models
1. **Seasonal Naive Model (SNaive)**: A simple model used as a benchmark.
2. **ETS Model**: Captures trends and seasonal patterns.
3. **ARIMA Model**: The most accurate model for forecasting retail sales.

## Key Results
- The ARIMA model demonstrated the best fit, showing how the economy returned to predicted patterns post-COVID-19.
- The ETS model performed reasonably well but had some residual autocorrelation.

## Data
The retail sales data is sourced from [data source link].

## Instructions

2. Install necessary packages: `fpp2`, `ggplot2`, and `forecast`.
3. Run the analysis in the R Markdown file.
